<h1 align="center">Triple o Logos</h1> 

<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
Triple O Logo is a node application that generates a svg logo of either a triangle,circle, or square based off of what the user wants,
the user may also enter up to a 3 digit tag for their logo,
colors can also be entered for both the shape and text.
My task was to make a node application that makes a logo with a shape and some letters. It was a bit overwhelming at first not knowing where to start, I ended up writing to much and ended up with overlapping tags, i eneded up getting it to work after a while of working on one shape, then the other two were much easier.
